 <u><b>Paragraph</b></u>
<p>“The road may be long, tortuous and wearied. But the resulting success is enduring,
     sure and sweet. The fool abandons hope in the wearied journey of life.
      The wise gets going - holding firmly to the promise of a better tomorrow. 
      He that gives up too soon fails to understand that life rewards with success only those who cling on to hope against hope.
       Those who hope when it is unfashionable to hope.”

        Life is a gamble from minute to minute so play it today for all there is in it. 
        The flick of an eye lash, the quirk of a smile.
         A good deed here and there makes it all worthwhile. 
         So make life a garden for everyday and gather your rosebudes while you may.
